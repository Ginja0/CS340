To write a code that is maintainable, readable and adaptable, I focus on keeping the code to the simplest form. I could reuse the code I wrote in this form with any other database. The code creates, reads, and updates any code based on the data base. Minor changes at the end code would determine what database it would use. 

I focused on completing the requirements that the client had. I also imagine what else I could do to go above and beyond their expectations. 

Computer scientists design software that can work with different databases. They provide solutions for problems that companies have. In grazioso Salvare, they need help to complete their work with all the data they receive. Making a database to hold the data and have it easily readable and updatable helps them do their jobs.
